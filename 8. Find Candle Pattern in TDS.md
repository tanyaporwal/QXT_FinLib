### How to find candle pattern in TimeDataSeries?

Detecting candlestick patterns in a TimeDataSeries involves analyzing the sequence of price action to identify specific chart patterns, such as Doji, Hammer, and many others. These patterns often signal potential changes in market sentiment or trends, providing valuable insights for traders and analysts.

To find candlestick patterns in a TimeDataSeries, developers can leverage built-in pattern recognition algorithms within QXFinLib. These algorithms are designed to detect various common candlestick patterns automatically from the historical price data stored in the TimeDataSeries instance. These algorithms analyze the open, high, low, and close prices of each candlestick in the TimeDataSeries to identify specific patterns based on predefined criteria. Some common pattern name are Doji, Hammer, Shooting Star, Engulfing Patter etc.

The candlestick based pattern are defined as enumerated value and represented by enum CandlePatternType . There are more than 50+ such pre build pattern defined to be used.

User can themselves write such pattern finding logic in their code:

```

TimeDataSeries tds = TimeDataSeries.GetDailyBarCompression();

……
……

//Maximum High Yesterday - (MHY)
//Yesterday is the maximum High in the last 5 days */
//MHY = HHV(H, 5) == Ref(H, -1);

if (barIndex >= 5 &&  tds.HHV('H', barIndex, 5) == tds [barIndex - 1].High)
{
    // MHY patern found at barindex
}



//Hammer = (((H-L)>3*(O-C)) AND ((C-L)/(0.001+H-L)>0.6) AND ((O-L)/(0.001+H-L)>0.6)); 
if((((tds[barIndex].High - tds[barIndex].Low) > 3 * (tds[barIndex].Open - tds[barIndex].Close)) &&
                ((tds[barIndex].Close - tds[barIndex].Low) / (0.001 + tds[barIndex].High - tds[barIndex].Low) > 0.6) &&
                ((tds[barIndex].Open - tds[barIndex].Low) / (0.001 + tds[barIndex].High - tds[barIndex].Low) > 0.6)))
{
    // Hammer patter found at bar index
}
```
