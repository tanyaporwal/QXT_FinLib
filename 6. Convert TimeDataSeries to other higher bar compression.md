### How to Convert TimeDataSeries to any other higher bar Compression?

Converting a TimeDataSeries to a different bar compression interval offers flexibility in analyzing market data at various time resolutions. TimeDataSeries enables users to specify their desired compression interval, ensuring data consistency and integrity when converting to the target compression.

For instance, you can convert a 15-minute compression TimeDataSeries from any Bar Data Series with a compression interval of 1 minute, 3 minutes, or 5 minutes, provided that the lower compression Bar Data is an absolute divisible of the target compression. This conversion process maintains data accuracy and preserves the structure of the original TimeDataSeries while adapting it to the new compression interval.

```
TimeDataSeries tds1Minute = Load1MinuteTimeSeriesDataFromCSV();

// Create 5 Minute TimeData Series object and fill all 1 Min Bar Data to it.
// 300 value represent 300 seconds which is equal to 5 Minute
TimeDataSeries timeDataSeries5Min = TimeDataSeries.GetMinutesBarCompression(300, BarType.CandleStick);
foreach (IBarData barData in tds1Minute)
{
    timeDataSeries5Min.AddBarData(barData.DateTimeDT, barData.Open, barData.High, barData.Low, barData.Close, barData.Volume);
}

// The timeDataSeries5Min time data series is now hold compressed data in 5 minute timeframe
//  with bar time stamps move as  09:15, 09:20, 09:25.....
```

This code snippet demonstrates how to convert a TimeDataSeries with 1-minute compression to a new TimeDataSeries with a 5-minute compression. It iterates through each bar in the 1-minute series and adds them to the 5-minute series, resulting in compressed data with bar timestamps at 5-minute intervals.
