### TimeDataSeries


The **TimeDataSeries** class within QXFinLib plays a crucial role in representing historical market data through candlestick bars. Each candlestick bar encapsulates OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data points for a specific time interval, allowing for comprehensive analysis of price movements over time. 

Within TimeDataSeries, historical market data is organized into a collection of bars, with each bar representing a single candlestick. These bars contain OHLCV data points for a specific time frame determined by the compression interval such as seconds, minutes, daily, weekly, or monthly. For example, if the compression interval is set to minutes, each candlestick bar may represent a one-minute time frame, summarizing price action and trading activity during that period.

Overall, **TimeDataSeries** provides a structured and efficient way to organize historical market data into candlestick bars, enabling traders and analysts to analyze price movements, identify trends, and make informed decisions in algorithmic trading and quantitative finance applications.

Here is example of bar representation and candlestick chart. TimeDataSeries serves as an object representation of a periodic bar collection.

### Constructor
```
TimeDataSeries tdSeries = new TimeDataSeries(BarCompression.MinuteBar, 
                compressionSecond,          	
                BarType.CandleStick,        	
                new TimeSpan(9, 15, 0),     	
                new TimeSpan(15, 30, 0));   	
```
// Compression interval type
// For 1 minute candle, use value 60        
// Bar Type(CandleStick/HeikinAshi)
// Day trading session start time
// Day trading session end time

#### **Other important points** 
- Time points are internally represented in Unix timestamps (seconds elapsed since January 1st, 1971)..
- Only price points within the defined daily trading range (e.g., 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM) are considered for bar formation.
- You can add price data using AddTickData or AddBarData functions..
- User can bind an event OnBarDataCompletedEvent on TimeDataSeries to capture a new bar completion event. 
- If trading session is specified as 09:15-15:30, bar compression as MinuteBar of say 30 Minutes. 
  The bar data interval will be: 09:15, 09:45, 10:15, …………..15:15, 15:30 for a given day
   09:15 represent a time of first bar of a day and constitutes of all price points from 09:15 till 09:44:59.999 in case 
   of 30 minute compression.
- Note here that bar time is always an initial time of the bar interval.

This example demonstrates how to generate OHLC bar data (BarData) from a stream of tick prices using TimeDataSeries. The TimeDataSeries internally accumulates data points to form bars based on the chosen compression interval and compression value.

In this example, we create a 15 second bar compression TimeDataSeries structure.
**AddTickData** function is used generate a TimeDataSeries from tick prices stream and corresponding volume.

```

             int compressionSecond = 15;

             TimeDataSeries tdSeries = new TimeDataSeries(
                               BarCompression.MinuteBar,
                               compressionSecond,
                               BarType.CandleStick,
                               new TimeSpan(9, 15, 0),       // Day session Start time
                               new TimeSpan(15, 30, 0));   // Day session End time);

            tdSeries.OnBarDataCompletedEvent += OnBarDataCompletedEvent;

            CultureInfo provider = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;
            string dateTimeFormatter = "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.fff";

            // Adding a tick data with LTP 50 and LTQ 10 and datetime representing a LTT
            tdSeries.AddTickData(DateTime.ParseExact("2020-12-08 09:15:01.123", dateTimeFormatter,  provider), 50, 10);

            tdSeries.AddTickData(DateTime.ParseExact("2020-12-08 09:15:02.234", dateTimeFormatter,  provider), 60, 5);
            tdSeries.AddTickData(DateTime.ParseExact("2020-12-08 09:15:04.512", dateTimeFormatter,  provider), 45, 15);
            tdSeries.AddTickData(DateTime.ParseExact("2020-12-08 09:15:05.777", dateTimeFormatter,  provider), 60, 20);


            tdSeries.AddTickData(DateTime.ParseExact("2020-12-08 09:17:09.913", dateTimeFormatter,  provider), 100, 10);
            tdSeries.AddTickData(DateTime.ParseExact("2020-12-08 09:18:11.999", dateTimeFormatter,  provider), 95, 30);

            Assert.AreEqual(tdSeries.Count, 4);

            IBarData barData = tdSeries[0];
            Assert.AreEqual(barData.DateTimeDT.TimeOfDay, new TimeSpan(09, 15, 00));
            Assert.AreEqual(barData.Open, 50);
            Assert.AreEqual(barData.High, 60);
            Assert.AreEqual(barData.Low, 50);
            Assert.AreEqual(barData.Close, 60);
            Assert.AreEqual(barData.Volume, 15);

The **AddTickData** function plays a crucial role in generating bar data within a TimeDataSeries, particularly when historical data is available in the form of tick data or when receiving a real-time stream of traded prices. This function allows for the aggregation of individual ticks into bars, facilitating the creation of a comprehensive bar series for analysis and further processing.

When historical tick data is available, the **AddTickData** function can be utilized to systematically aggregate these ticks into bars based on the specified compression interval. Each tick received represents a single transaction or price update in the market. By accumulating ticks over the defined compression period, the function generates bars with Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (OHLCV) data points, providing a summarized view of price action within each bar interval.

Similarly, in real-time trading scenarios, where a continuous stream of traded prices is received, the **AddTickData** function can be employed to dynamically update the bar series as new ticks arrive. This ensures that the bar series remains up-to-date with the latest market activity, allowing traders to analyze current price movements and make informed decisions in real-time.

In essence, the **AddTickData** function serves as a versatile tool for constructing a bar series from tick data, whether in historical analysis or real-time trading environments. It enables the transformation of raw tick-level information into structured bar data, facilitating comprehensive market analysis and strategy development.
The AddTickData function is not just about aggregating ticks into bars; it also triggers the generation of a new bar and the firing of the **OnBarDataCompletedEvent** event when the ticks accumulated reach the end of the compression interval, forming a complete bar. This event-driven mechanism is crucial for real-time monitoring and analysis of market data within a TimeDataSeries.

When new ticks are detected and added using the AddTickData function, the TimeDataSeries continuously accumulates these ticks until the compression interval is reached. Once the interval is complete, the accumulated ticks are transformed into a single bar, encapsulating the relevant OHLCV data points for that interval.

At this point, the **OnBarDataCompletedEvent** event is triggered, providing notification that a new bar has been formed and is ready for processing. This event allows developers to implement custom logic or execute specific actions based on the completion of each bar. For example, traders may use this event to perform technical analysis, generate trading signals, or update their strategy's state.
